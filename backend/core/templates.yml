# NAPKIN_TEMPLATE: |
#   Create a premium paper napkin that combines artistic illustration with elegant finishing, inspired by hand-painted watercolor and modern vector styles. The design should be versatile, print-ready, and themed for {theme_label}.

#   Primary Design Concept
#   - Central motif: {motif} with a {background_treatment} background.
#   - Composition: single focal composition, uncluttered.
#     • Artwork coverage: target ~{coverage_target} of the canvas.
#     • Keep at least {min_margin_each_side} clean margin on each side; corners must remain empty.
#     • Do not fill edges; no all-over pattern; no heavy emboss.
#   - Metallic detail: {metallic_finish} (thin, subtle).

#   Style & Inspiration
#   - Illustration Style: {illustration_style}.
#   - Botanical Motifs: {botanical_motifs}.
#   - Animal/Seasonal Motifs: {animal_motifs}.
#   - Rim Enhancement: {rim_style} (thin, minimal).
#   - Backgrounds: {background_library} (very light).

#   Color Palette Strategy
#   - Base tones: {base_tones}.

#   Decorative Elements
#   - Florals/Leaves: {decorative_florals}; keep to maximum {max_floral_clusters} clusters total.
#   - Icons: {decorative_icons}; icons count ≤ {max_icon_count}.
#   - Borders: {border_style}. Keep rim thin and clean; avoid filling with florals.
#   - Negative Space: leave at least 30–40% of canvas empty background.

#   Typography (Optional)
#   - Use typography: {use_typography}.
#   - Copy (if any): "{typography_copy}".
#   - Type style: {typography_style}. Placement: {typography_placement}. Color: {typography_color}.

#   Production Specs (treat as constraints, not literal text)
#   - Resolution: 300 DPI minimum (upscale if needed), export vector-like crispness.
#   - Color Mode: CMYK-friendly rendering with separate gold foiling layer indication.
#   - Safe zones: Keep center motif within 5mm of plate edge; include 3mm bleed.
#   - Material: Compatible with paperboard + eco-friendly substrates.
#   - Finish: {finish_spec}.

#   Format & Output
#   - Aspect: {aspect}. Size: {size_hint}. Quality: {quality_hint}.
#   - Deliver a clean, high-contrast scene suitable for print; no watermark, no brand text.
